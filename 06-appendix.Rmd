<!-- ### Exercise 2: Dominant and Recessive Traits{#solution2} -->

<!-- 1) There are 75 individuals in the population with at least 1 recessive allele (50 with genotype Bb and 25 with genotype bb). Hence, the probability that a randomly selected individual has 1 recessive allele is $75/100=.75$. -->

<!-- 2) There are 75 individuals with brown eyes in the population (25 with genotype BB and 50 with genotype Bb). Of these, 50 have 1 recessive allele. The probability that a randomly selected individual has 1 recessive allele given that they have brown eyes is $50/75=.67$.  -->

   A great book for ecologists written by two of the leading Bayesian statisticians in the field of ecological staitistics: Dr. William Link (formerly of the USGS) and Dr. Richard Barker (University of Otago, New Zealand). Drs. Link and Barker bring their extensive experience working with ecologists to provide a discussion of Bayesian inference aimed at the level of those analysing data that is grounded in real world examples with accompanying R/JAGS code.

   Fondly known as the puppy book because of the cover photo, this book covers Bayesian inference from the ground up for non-statisticians. The text is designed for a general audience, and provides many examples from different fields. It includes worked examples in R and JAGS/Stan with accompanying code.

   A rather dense book (both literally and figuratively), this is often considered as the canonical text on Bayesian data analysis. The lead author, Dr. Andrew Gelman, is a professor of Statistics and Political Science at Columbia University, and a prolific researcher in the area of modern Bayesian inference.
