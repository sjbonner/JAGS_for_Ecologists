### Exercise 2: Dominant and Recessive Traits

1) There are 75 individuals in the population with at least 1 recessive allele (50 with genotype Bb and 25 with genotype bb). Hence, the probability that a randomly selected individual has 1 recessive allele is $75/100=.75$.

2) There are 75 individuals with brown eyes in the population (25 with genotype BB and 50 with genotype Bb). Of these, 50 have 1 recessive allele. The probability that a randomly selected individual has 1 recessive allele given that they have brown eyes is $50/75=.67$.
